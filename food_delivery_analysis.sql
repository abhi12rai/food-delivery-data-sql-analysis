-- ðŸ“‹ Problem 5: Query for Trigger After Every Third Order
-- Below is the basic query for finding every third order.

-- 1.
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT *,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Customer_code ORDER BY Placed_at) AS order_number
    FROM orders
)
SELECT * 
FROM cte

-- In a production environment, to avoid sending duplicate triggers, we should limit it to today's orders only. Here's how:

-- 2.
WITH cte AS (
    SELECT *,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Customer_code ORDER BY Placed_at) AS order_number
    FROM orders
)
SELECT * 
FROM cte 
WHERE order_number % 3 = 0 
  AND CAST(Placed_at AS DATE) = CAST(NOW() AS DATE);

-- Insight:
-- First query identifies customers who have placed their 3rd, 6th, 9th (and so on) orders, enabling the Growth team to trigger personalized 
-- communications at every third order milestone.
-- And the last query ensures only today's qualifying events are targeted to avoid duplicate messaging.

-- ðŸ“‹ Problem 6: Customers Who Placed More Than One Order Using Promo Codes

SELECT

    COUNT(Promo_code_Name) AS promo_order
FROM orders
GROUP BY Customer_code
HAVING no_of_order > 1 
   AND promo_order = no_of_order;

-- ðŸ“‹ Problem 7: What Percent of Customers Were Organically Acquired in Jan 2025

-- Note: Since the dataset only contains orders from 2025, 
-- it is appropriate to filter WHERE MONTH(Placed_at) = 1 inside the CTE itself without causing any issues.

WITH cte AS (
    SELECT *, 
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Customer_code ORDER BY Placed_at ASC) AS rnk

            COUNT(DISTINCT Customer_code), 
        2), 
    "%") AS customer_pct
FROM cte;

-- Insight:
-- Calculates what percent of customers acquired in January 2025 placed their first order without using a promo.
